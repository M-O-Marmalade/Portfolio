                                <h1>The Concept</h1>
                                <p>Being a musician (drums, synths), one of my favorite programs is <a href="https://www.renoise.com/products/renoise">Renoise</a>. After learning to program, I remembered that Renoise offers a <a href="https://github.com/renoise/xrnx">Lua API</a> to create extensions of the program! I decided to make a game within Renoise. Wanting something classic, I decided on Pong. The only other game made using the Renoise API is a <a href="https://www.renoise.com/tools/nibbles">port of Nibbles</a> ("Nibbles" is a <a href="https://youtu.be/bo2rr1X4dOg?t=82">Snake clone included in FastTracker2</a>).</p>

                        </div>
                        <h1>The Development</h1>
                        <h2>Learning Lua</h2>
                        <p>I started learning Lua using the official <a href="https://www.lua.org/pil/contents.html">guide</a> and <a href="https://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/">documentation</a>. I already had a decent understanding of dynamically typed languages, garbage collection, etc, from dabbling in C#. As I worked with Lua, I found my favorite feature of the language to be tables. Compared to having to choose between structs, arrays, vectors, hashmaps, etc, on a case-by-case basis in C++, tables were so simple and flexible! Of course there is some performance trade-off for that ease of use, but I really enjoyed working with them!</p>
                        <h2>Engineering a Display</h2>
                        <p>The Renoise API offers a limited set of GUI elements for use in building your tool&#39;s interface. One of those elements is a bitmap that can be loaded from file. I found that by creating and dynamically updating a grid of bitmaps, I was able to create a &quot;virtual screen&quot; within my tool&#39;s GUI! Renoise can only handle updating a limited amount of these bitmaps at once, though. As a result, I had to manually update only bitmaps that needed to change from the previous frame one by one at runtime (eg, setting the bitmap at the ball&#39;s current position to white, then setting its previous position to black), rather than clearing the whole screen and redrawing everything fresh each frame.</p>
                        <h1>The Launch</h1>
                        <p>After some development, the game was becoming pretty fun, with a rainbow that trailed behind the ball, an AI opponent, a 2-player mode, sound effects (via loading instruments and note sequences into the currently open Renoise project and starting/stopping playback), and more! Within 24 hours of its release on <a href="www.renoise.com">the official Renoise website</a>, it was featured on the <a href="https://www.renoise.com/tools">front page</a> of the website&#39;s &quot;Tools&quot; section (where it still remains featured after almost a year and a half, despite many other tools being released since), and received recognition from Renoise&#39;s lead programmer and CEO Eduard Müller (aka taktik).</p>
                        <h1>The Update</h1>
                        <h2>Upgrading the Display</h2>
                        <p>After its release, I wanted to capitalize on the exposure the game was getting by adding more visual effects the game. The game ran at 25 frames/second, but at this speed I could only update about ~100 bitmaps each frame—not a good budget to enhance the visuals any further. I had considered using a lookup table of larger bitmaps that would &quot;puzzle-piece together&quot; to create each frame, requiring Renoise to update less than 100 bitmaps each frame, while giving the appearance of a very high-resolution display, but I ended up finding a better solution (although the &quot;puzzle piece&quot; method sounded like a lot of fun to implement). I discovered that Renoise provided another GUI element more capable for my purposes than the bitmaps I was using.</p>
                        <h2>Buttons</h2>
                        <p>Buttons are an element type that can be customized in many ways, including their <code>width</code>, <code>height</code>, and—most importantly—<code>color</code>. Buttons are the only Renoise API element that offer the ability to set their color to a HEX color-code! If the <code>width</code>,  <code>height</code> , and <code>margin</code> properties are set low enough, the buttons have no borders, and fill their occupied pixels completely with the <code>color</code> you set them to. This meant I now had a full 8-bit color display, capable of easily displaying 16,777,216 different colors, fully controllable through code! To my delight, I also found that Renoise can update them 9x faster than bitmaps, at ~900 buttons/frame at 25 frames/second! This allowed me to clear the frame buffer and redraw everything from scratch each frame, instead of manually clearing individual bitmaps. I then implemented a system that compared the current frame buffer to the previous frame&#39;s buffer, and then only pushed color updates to the buttons that had changed color since the previous frame, offering a performance boost whenever less than ~900 buttons were actually changing color each frame!</p>
                        <h2>Utilizing the New Display</h2>
                        <p>I had been studying some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160418004149/http://freespace.virgin.net/hugo.elias/graphics/x_water.htm">water simulation algorithms</a> for use in my 3D graphics projects, and realized that given these optimizations, I could implement a water simulation in my Pong game for some fun visuals! The latest update to the game at the time of writing this, consisted of this water effect, some small GUI changes, and the switch from bitmaps to buttons as a display method.</p>
                        <h1>Reflecting</h1>
                        <p>If I were to continue working on this project, I would spice up the sound effects and how they react to gameplay, and I would add a Breakout-style game mode. The work I did on this project inspired me with plans to write a 3D renderer using Renoise&#39;s Lua API, and create a small 3D game using it. Other projects are currently higher priorities, but it does sound really fun, and I do plan on doing it soon!</p>
                        <h2>Hopes</h2>
                        <p>I love Renoise as a program, but I worry that they don&#39;t make much of a profit as a business. Renoise has a niche approach to music composition in today&#39;s market. Its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_tracker">tracker-style approach</a> allows for efficient music composition using only keyboard commands—no mouse required. Back in the 80s and 90s this was a common way to create MIDI compositions. However, most users today are not looking for this approach in a music program. One of my hopes is that the games that I create for Renoise will attract more like-minded users to the program, and keep its development alive for years to come.</p>
