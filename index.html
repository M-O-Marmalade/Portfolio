                                    <h1>The Concept</h1>
                                    <p>
                                        After the launch of <a onclick="switchCard(this, 'reform', 'paddles')">Paddles</a>, the need for a new Renoise tool became apparent; one that would make it quick and intuitive to powerfully fine–tune strums.
                                        The idea was inspired by FL Studio's <a href="https://www.image-line.com/fl-studio-learning/fl-studio-online-manual/html/pianoroll_strum.htm">&quot;Strumizer&quot; tool</a>. 
                                        It offers knobs and sliders to edit timings and velocities.
                                        You get realtime visual feedback of your changes to the notes.
                                        You can preview the audio by pressing the spacebar. 
                                        Renoise, in comparison, lacks any such abilities, requiring users to edit notes one–by–one instead.

                                    <h2>The Problem</h2>
                                    <p>
                                        Being a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_tracker">tracker</a>, Renoise represents musical notes as text on a spreadsheet. 
                                        By default, each cell on the spreadsheet corresponds to a 16th note. 
                                        To have notes trigger in–between this 16th–note grid, you must type a hexadecimal value 0x00–0x80 into the "delay" column next to the note. 
                                        This results in an inefficient process for creating strums that are not in sync with the grid's time division, requiring the user to manually type individual hexadecimal values for each note.

                                    <p>
                                        A strum–editing tool for Renoise that would include: a playful UI, intuitive controls, realtime updates to notes, easy preview playback, strumming across pattern boundaries, and more. 
                                        This would be quite a complex task to achieve in a tracker–based application.

                            <section>

                                    <h2>Caching</h2>
                                    <p>
                                        To allow manipulated notes to overflow into other patterns, avoid colliding with other notes, and wrap from the end of the song to the beginning, it was necessary to know pattern lengths, song lengths, note positions, and more. 
                                        The handing-over of all that data from Renoise's C++ runtime to its Lua API is slow, and Reform demands huge amounts of that data rapidly, hundreds of times per second.
                                        To improve performance, the data would be cached Lua–side after retrieving it from the Renoise runtime, and Renoise's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern">Observer–style</a> notifiers would be used to alert Reform when cached data was no longer valid.
                                        This resulted in a dramatic increase in performance (over <b>100x</b>), and was architected in an easy-to-use, modular API.

                                        The implementation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve">Beziér curves</a> in Reform (developed via the <a onclick="switchCard(this, 'reform', 'curves')">Curves</a> demo) allowed for selections of notes to have their timings "bent". 
                                        Note timings are interpreted as being linearly distributed upon selection, and can then be redistributed along a Quadratic Beziér curve, or an S-shaped Cubic curve. 
                                        More curve shapes could easily be added, and users could even be allowed to create custom curves via an editor, but for the majority of use–cases, these two curve types are sufficient.

                                    <h1>The Concept</h1>
                                    <p>
                                        Being a musician (drums, synths), one of my favorite programs is <a href="https://www.renoise.com/products/renoise">Renoise</a>. 
                                        After learning to program, I remembered that Renoise offers a <a href="https://github.com/renoise/xrnx">Lua API</a> to create extensions of the program! 
                                        I decided to make a game within Renoise. 
                                        Wanting something classic, I decided on Pong. 
                                        The only other game made using the Renoise API is a <a href="https://www.renoise.com/tools/nibbles">port of Nibbles</a> ("Nibbles" is a <a href="https://youtu.be/bo2rr1X4dOg?t=82">Snake clone included in FastTracker2</a>).
                                    </p>

                            <h1>The Development</h1>
                            <h2>Learning Lua</h2>
                            <p>
                                I learned Lua using the official <a href="https://www.lua.org/pil/contents.html">guide</a> and <a href="https://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/">documentation</a>. 
                                I found my favorite feature of the language to be tables. 
                                Tables are so simple in contrast to C++'s structs, arrays, enums, vectors, hashmaps, etc. 
                                If you understand how they work under the hood, they can be very performant, too!
                            </p>
                            <section>
                                <section class="text">
                                    <h2>Engineering a Display</h2>
                                    <p>
                                        The Renoise API doesn't really offer a way to directly control pixels. 
                                        Instead, it offers elements like sliders, knobs, text boxes, etc. 
                                        However, I found that I could control a grid of tiny bitmaps (loaded from the filesystem) to create a "virtual screen"! 
                                        Each frame, I had to manually update bitmaps, rather than blanking the whole screen and redrawing everything as graphics engines typically do, because Renoise isn't very fast at updating large amounts of bitmaps (it can update ~100 bitmaps at 25 frames/second).
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        After some development, the game had a rainbow that trailed behind the ball, an AI opponent, a 2-player mode, sound effects, and more! 
                                        Within 24 hours of its release, it was featured on the <a href="https://www.renoise.com/tools">front page of the Renoise website's "Tools" section</a> (where it still remains today), and even received recognition from Renoise's lead programmer and CEO; Eduard Müller (aka "taktik").

                            <section>
                                <section class="text">
                                    <h2>Upgrading the Display</h2>
                                    <p>
                                        After the game's release, I discovered that Renoise provided another GUI element capable of creating a "virtual screen". 
                                        Buttons can be scaled, and colored via a HEX color-code. 
                                        This change offered a full 8-bit color display—capable of displaying 16,777,216 colors! 
                                        To top it off, Renoise updates them 9x faster than bitmaps! 
                                        I also implemented a double frame buffer system that only pushed updates to buttons that needed it. 
                                        This allowed for more complex graphics, as I could now blank the screen each frame!
                                    </p>

                                        I had been studying some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160418004149/http://freespace.virgin.net/hugo.elias/graphics/x_water.htm">water simulation algorithms</a> for use in my 3D graphics projects, and decided to implement a water simulation in my Pong game for some nice visuals! 
                                        The update was released and received more positive feedback from the Renoise community!

                                I would also like to write a 3D renderer for Renoise's Lua API someday, and create a small 3D game using it, though other projects are currently higher priorites.

                                        I sometimes worry that Renoise will cease development. 
                                        Its keyboard–only <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_tracker">tracker-style approach</a> was common from the 1980's to the early 2000's, but most users today prefer a piano–roll interface. 
                                        I hope that my Renoise tools will attract more like-minded users to the program, and keep its development alive for years to come.

                                    <p>
                                        During development on <a onclick="switchCard(this, 'curves', 'reform')">Reform</a>, the need arose for the calculation and rasterization of various curves. 
                                        My first solution was to use logarithmic functions. 
                                        They worked, but implementing discrete mathematical functions for different curve shapes wasn't a very robust solution. 
                                        I ended up going down a rabbit hole of math and 2D rasterization that yielded the desired result. 
                                        This project was the testing ground where I isolated this task.

                                        After a lot of digging, I found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve">Bézier Curves</a>. 
                                        Compared to Linear, Quadratic, and Cubic Bézier curves, I wanted my curves to support an infinite number of control points. 
                                        I found this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve#Recursive_definition">recursive definition of a Bézier curve</a>. 
                                        After implementing this—along with the associated functions for <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_coefficient">Binomial Coefficients</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernstein_polynomial">Bernstein Basis Polynomials</a>—my curves supported an infinite number of control points! 
                                        A very proud moment indeed!

                                        I wanted each control point to have a variable "weight" (or "tension") to control its influence on the curve. 
                                        I found an <i>amazing</i> resource called <a href="https://pomax.github.io/bezierinfo/">A Primer on Bézier Curves</a> by Mike Kamermans (aka "Pomax"), which contains a <a href="https://pomax.github.io/bezierinfo/#weightcontrol">chapter on adding this "weight"</a>! 
                                        After implementing this new math, I now had infinite-degree, weighted, Bézier curves!

                                        Bézier curves are rendered in a unique way.
                                        Rather than solving for X / Y coordinates per–pixel, you have to solve for <code>t</code>—which represents an interpolation between the curve's endpoints.

                                        A naive approach is to just sample a high number of points, and fill the pixels where those points lie.
                                        The result of this approach is a curve that's too thick in high–tension segments, and breaking apart in low–tension segments.
                                        A better approach was clearly needed.

                                        My solution was to sample a moderate amount of points, and connect them with line segments, which are easier to rasterize (which I later discovered is called <a href="https://pomax.github.io/bezierinfo/#flattening">&quot;flattening&quot; the curve</a>). 
                                        More robust solutions have been documented (such as in Chapter 4 of <a href="https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:61935445">A Rasterizing Algorithm for Drawing Curves</a> by <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/author/Alois-Zingl/70155051">Alois Zingl</a>), but this solution would be sufficient, and quicker to implement. 
                                        Wanting pixel–perfect, aliased lines, I found the <a href="http://members.chello.at/~easyfilter/bresenham.html">Bresenham algorithm</a>, which yielded a beautiful result!

                                        I will definitely be utilizing the knowledge from this project in other future projects as well! 
                                        I can already imagine the possibilities of what can be created using these techniques!

                                This was my first substantial programming project. 
                                I chose C++ as my first programming language because I wanted a low–level foundation for my understanding of programming, and because I find working with computers at a low level to be fun and interesting (for these reasons, I&#39;ve also dabbled in <a href="https://rgbds.gbdev.io/docs/v0.5.1/gbz80.7/">GBZ80 assembly</a>, and the circuitry of GameBoy modding). 
                                I chose the Windows Console for my first project because it has a very simple API that would allow me to focus on learning fundamental programming concepts.

                                        The game was first rendered using <code>cout</code> statements, but this didn&#39;t result in a framerate–capable runtime (although it did have a cool film–like effect). 
                                        So I learned and refactored my code to write directly to the console buffer using the <code>WriteConsoleOutputCharacter()</code> function, which resulted in a stable image capable of faster framerates. 
                                        It also allowed me to easily add some color to the game, using the <code>WriteConsoleOutputAttribute()</code> function.

                                        From this endeavor I learned how to read API documentation, which assured me that I would be able to learn and use any libraries I want for future projects. 
                                        I did successfully add sound effects, as well as music that is synced to the player&#39;s movement (each frame that the snake moves corresponds to an 8th note in the music). 
                                        The music also reacts when the player eats a fruit exactly on a downbeat, gets a new high score, and more.

                                Now that I&#39;ve matured as a developer, I can see there are areas in this project where code can be cleaned up, and more elegant solutions can be implemented for certain features. 
                                But, I&#39;ve decided to leave it as–is for the time being, and learn new technologies with more potential for a wider impact. 
                                If I were to return to this project, my first priority would be to make it cross–platform with Windows, Linux, and Mac. 
                                Then I would add more gameplay features and visual effects.

                            <h1>Design</h1>
                            <p>
                                I love 3D graphics.
                                My favorite 3D effect is refraction, particularly when used to create water.
                                I thought an interactive water effect would make my portfolio website a lot of fun to browse.

                            <h1>Adaptive Performance</h1>
                            <p>
                                To accomodate a wide range of devices, Three.js's rendering resolution gets reduced on-the-fly if the current framerate is too low.
                                This allows for an HD experience on high-end devices, while still maintaining a smooth framerate on lower-end devices.
                            </p>
                                <h1>Adaptive Geometry</h1>
                            <p>
                                The Quadratic formula is used to ensure the water's geometry has a consistent density of vertices regardless of the aspect ratio of the HTML document.
                                This means the water simulation moves at the same speed regardless of where or how the website is being viewed.

            <p>
				I'm a software developer specializing in audio DSP and 3D rasterization, primarily using C++!
            </p>
            <p>
                Though my language of specialization is C++, I have experience in a variety of other languages as well. Aside from specializing in digital audio and graphics, I also have some experience in web development, game programming, data and mathematics, UI design, and I learned quite a bit about text encodings (ASCII, UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32) while working on my console/terminal game development library, "<a href="https://github.com/M-O-Marmalade/ConArtist">ConArtist</a>". I truly enjoy learning, and there's no shortage of things to learn!
            </p>
            <p>
                Aside from programming, I'm a lifelong musician (drummer/percussionist, sound designer/synthesist, composer/producer), and I'm also practicing visual art (pixel art, 3D modeling, watercolor). As a result, I'm quite experienced with many modern audio/visual design softwares. I'm able to get audible and visible results fast, due to my experience with both designing/creating media, and writing code to utilize media in a realtime software environment.
